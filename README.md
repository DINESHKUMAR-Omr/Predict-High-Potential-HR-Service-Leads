# Predict-High-Potential-HR-Service-Leads
To predict which companies are likely to become high-potential leads for HR services based on their funding and hiring trends. The dataset includes synthetic data that mimics real-world information, allowing us to develop and test predictive models.
High-Potential HR Service Lead Prediction

1. Introduction
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a company is a high-potential HR service lead (is_hot_lead = 1) or not (is_hot_lead = 0). The solution involves comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to ensure accuracy and reliability.

2. Methodology
The approach follows a structured pipeline:
1.	Data Preprocessing ‚Äì Cleaning, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
2.	Feature Engineering ‚Äì Encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.
3.	Model Selection ‚Äì Implementing a Random Forest Classifier for classification.
4.	Model Evaluation ‚Äì Assessing model performance using key metrics.
5.	Prediction & Submission ‚Äì Generating and exporting predictions.

3. Data Preprocessing
3.1 Handling Missing Values
1.	Numerical Features: Imputed with the mean value.
2.	Categorical Features: Imputed with the mode (most frequent value).
3.2 Handling Outliers & Infinite Values
1.	Replaced infinite values (inf, -inf) with NaN.
2.	Capped extreme values at ¬±1,000,000 to maintain data integrity.
3.3 Encoding Categorical Features
1.	Applied Label Encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format.
2.	Handled unseen categories in the test set by assigning -1.

3.4 Ensuring Data Consistency
1.	Ensured the test dataset has the same feature set as the training dataset.
2.	Converted all numerical features to float32 to prevent datatype issues.

4. Model Implementation
The Random Forest Classifier was selected due to its:
‚úî Ability to handle numerical and categorical data efficiently.
‚úî Robustness to overfitting with sufficient estimators.
‚úî Strong performance on structured tabular data.

4.1 Model Hyperparameters
‚¶Å	n_estimators = 100: Number of decision trees.
‚¶Å	random_state = 42: Ensures reproducibility.
‚¶Å	test_size = 0.2: 80% training, 20% validation.

5. Evaluation Metrics
	Model performance is assessed using the following metrics:
5.1 Primary Metric: F1-Score
1.	Provides a balance between precision and recall, particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.
5.2 Secondary Metrics
1.	Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
2.	Precision: Indicates how many predicted positives are truly positive.
3.	Recall: Shows the proportion of actual positives correctly identified.

6. Prediction & Submission
	Once the model is trained, predictions are generated on test.csv, and results are stored in submission.csv.

7. Future Enhancements
To further improve performance, the following enhancements can be explored:
üîπ Feature Engineering: Adding interaction features, aggregations, or new derived variables.
üîπ Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters using Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization.
üîπ Alternative Models: Experimenting with XGBoost, LightGBM, or Neural Networks.
üîπ Handling Imbalanced Data: Implementing SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

8. Output
The results will be stored in submission.csv.

10. Conclusion
This project successfully builds a binary classification model to predict high-potential HR service leads. The Random Forest Classifier provides a reliable balance between interpretability and performance. Future enhancements will focus on fine-tuning the model and exploring alternative techniques to further optimize accuracy and generalization.
